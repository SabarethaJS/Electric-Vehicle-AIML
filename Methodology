1. Data Collection:
   • Collected EV dataset including Make, Model, Model Year, and Base MSRP
   • Labeled each vehicle as BEV or PHEV

2. Data Preprocessing:
   • Handled missing or inconsistent values
   • Converted categorical features (Make, Model) into numerical form using One-Hot Encoding
   • Combined encoded features with numerical features (Model Year, Base MSRP)

3. Model Training:
   • Selected a classifier suitable for predicting EV type
   • Split dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80% train, 20% test)
   • Trained the model to classify EV type accurately

4. Model Saving:
   • Saved the trained model as 'ev_type_model.pkl' using pickle
   • Ensures model can be loaded later without retraining

5. Chatbot Development:
   • Built an interactive web interface using Streamlit
   • Users can input Make, Model, Year, and Base MSRP
   • App predicts EV type (BEV or PHEV) in real-time

6. Testing and Validation:
   • Verified predictions with sample inputs
   • Ensured model outputs were consistent and accurate
