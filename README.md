# Electric Vehicle Type Classification using Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project is developed as a part of my AICTE Internship on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) under the theme *Electric Vehicles (EVs)*.
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to analyze electric vehicle data and build a predictive model that can classify the types of electric vehicles based on several key parameters.
This project highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in understanding EV performance, specifications, and market trends.

---

## Problem Statement

The growing demand for sustainable transportation has accelerated the adoption of electric vehicles. However, classifying electric vehicles accurately based on their specifications, model type, range, and battery capacity is essential for both manufacturers and researchers.
This project aims to build a simple yet efficient machine learning model that can classify different types of electric vehicles using structured data from a publicly available dataset.

---

## Objective

* To explore how AI and ML can be implemented in the field of electric vehicles.
* To classify electric vehicles based on their specifications and performance parameters.
* To preprocess and analyze EV-related data to understand relationships between features such as model year, range, and battery capacity.
* To visualize patterns and correlations that could assist in the improvement of EV technology and design.

## Importance of the Project

Electric vehicles are a major step toward reducing pollution and dependency on fossil fuels.
Machine learning enables automation in vehicle analysis, helps predict performance, and assists industries in decision-making.
This project acts as a small-scale model for understanding how AI-powered classification systems can be integrated into real-world electric mobility analytics.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project has been downloaded from Kaggle. It contains detailed information about electric vehicles including:

* Vehicle ID
* Manufacturer (Make)
* Model Name
* Model Year
* Electric Vehicle Type (Battery Electric or Plug-in Hybrid)
* Electric Range
* Base MSRP (Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price)
* Legislative District and Vehicle Location
* Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Eligibility

The dataset is uploaded in this GitHub repository for easy access during model training and testing.

## Methodology

The overall workflow of this project is divided into multiple stages:

1. **Dataset Collection:**

   * The dataset was collected from Kaggle’s “Electric Vehicle Population Data” repository.

2. **Data Upload and Storage:**

   * The dataset file was uploaded to this GitHub repository for version control and reproducibility.

3. **Data Understanding:**

   * The dataset structure and attributes were studied to understand feature relationships and their significance.

4. **Preprocessing (Week 2):**

   * The dataset will be cleaned, null values will be handled, and categorical data will be encoded.

5. **Model Building (Week 2):**

   * A classification algorithm (like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest) will be implemented to classify EVs.

6. **Model Evaluation (Week 2):**

   * Model accuracy and performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score will be analyzed.
