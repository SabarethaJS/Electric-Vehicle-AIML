1. Programming Language: Python

Python is used for data processing, machine learning, and building the chatbot.

Popular for ML projects because of readable syntax and wide library support.

2. Libraries:

pandas

Used to read, clean, and manipulate datasets.

Handles tabular data like Make, Model, Year, MSRP efficiently.

scikit-learn

Provides machine learning algorithms for classification.

Used to train a model that predicts EV type (BEV/PHEV).

Offers tools for preprocessing, model evaluation, and saving the trained model.

streamlit

Used to build a web-based interactive interface (chatbot).

Allows users to enter EV details and get real-time predictions.

Requires minimal code compared to building a full web app.

3. IDE: VS Code / PyCharm

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and managing Python code.

Features like syntax highlighting, debugging, and version control integration make coding easier.

4. Platform for Chatbot: Streamlit

Streamlit runs the chatbot in a browser interface, making it easy for users to interact.

Users don’t need to know Python to use the app.

5. Web Browser

Required to open the Streamlit app after running streamlit run app.py.

Compatible with Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.

6. Machine Learning Concepts Used

Data Preprocessing: Handling categorical variables like Make and Model using One-Hot Encoding.

Model Training: Training a classifier to predict EV type based on input features.

Model Persistence: Saving the trained model using pickle so it can be reused without retraining.
